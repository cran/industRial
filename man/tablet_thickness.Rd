\title{Thickness measurements of pharmaceutical tablets}
\format{
An object of class tibble with 675 observations on 11 variables
}
\source{
Based on a gage r&R (gage reproducibility and repeatability) 
study performed in 2020 on a physical measurement of parts coming out of a 
high throughput industrial equipment.
}
\usage{
tablet_thickness
}
\description{
This data set contains physical measurements of pharmaceutical 
tablets (pills) including measurement room conditions. The data and the 
insights it provides are typical of an industrial context with high production
throughput and stringent dimensional requirements.
}
\details{
The data set contains other variables not used in the text book related with 
to the measurement room conditions (not listed).

\describe{
  \item{Position}{Position of the part on the measurement device}
  \item{Size}{Size class (L, M, S)}
  \item{Tablet}{Part number (L001, L002, ...)}
  \item{Replicate}{Measurement replicate, a sequential numbers}
  \item{Day}{Measurement Day, a sequential numbers}
  \item{Date [DD.MM.YYYY]}{Measurement date (POSIXct)}
  \item{Operator}{Operator name (ficticious)}
  \item{Thickness [micron]}{Tablet thickness (micrometers)}
  \item{Temperature [Â°C]}{Room temperature}
}
